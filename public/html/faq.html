                    If you decide that you no longer want your order for any reason you can cancel it. ​Once a campaign ends, however, we are unable to cancel an order as the information has already been sent to the manufacturer and the item will be shipped anyway.  In this instance, you can return your item once you receive it for a full refund.

                  All sales transactions take place once the minimum number of orders required to manufacture the campaign have been met.  This number is generated by a wide variety of factors, so it will differ between campaigns. Generally, though, the minimum tends to be between 3-5 orders.

                  There are two ways to place a Genesus order. One way is on a computer, and the other is over a mobile device. On both devices, these are the steps to follow:
                  <br>
                  <br>
1. Navigate to the campaign page you're interested in
                  <br>
                  <br>
2. Click the green button, which will either say "Reserve It Now" or "Buy It Now"

                  Genesus was born on a whim and founded by Alek and Austin Matthiessen while the two were seniors at Brown University and Emory University. After using nutrition products for 10 years, they realized most of the formula's were the same and wanted to build their own brand. The process was horrific, sending quotes back and forth and putting up thousands of dollars with no guaranteed sales. They knew there had to be a better way, so they built one.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  The Genesus platform allows people to take their own personal brand and experience, create various supplements, and then sell them without the overhead costs or restrictions usually associated with starting an online store. Our platform sells the items in campaigns (or limited edition runs) so we can manufacture and ship in bulk. This process keeps our costs low and allows us to help build small brands by offering fair and profitable pricing on manufacturing and products to our sellers.

                  We've partnered with manufacturers all of the United States to produce supplements we can believe in. Each of our facilities is cGMP certified, FDA Registered, and makes all of their raw ingredients in the United States of America. Each of our products is also 100% transparent and free of any additives or fillers. As standard procedure we test all incoming raw materials, as well as finished products, and test each batch for disintegration time.

  We also use amber colored recyclable glass bottles preserve freshnessglass bottles, labels list all ingredients to avoid consumer allergic reactions to unnamed ingredients, Best By dates guarantee freshness, and full body, tamper-evident sleeves ensure consumer safety.

                  Since the beginning, we’ve gone one step further in assuring the gluten free status of our products by testing our finished products for gluten. We confirm that none of the products we offer contain more than 10 ppm gluten, and use this logo on the front panel of the label. Our program provides a consistent, science-based set of standards that helps consumers easily choose our premium supplements. In mid-2013 the FDA announced a decision defining Gluten Free as 20ppm, more than double what we allow in products. All finished products undergo gluten testing using an ELISA (Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) procedure (a machine that detects the presence of an antigen in a sample) to detect the presence of gluten.

                  We believe offering organic alternatives to dietary supplements provides the end consumer with a wholesome product that supports the cycle of global sustainability and thus adds value for our retail accounts. All our products are nestled in plant-based biodegradable packaging materials and shipped in corrugated cartons with an overall recycled content of 65% (considered to be the highest recycled content possible while maintaining box integrity during packing and shipping). More than half of our products meet the guidelines of the USDA National Organic Program.

                  Ready to start your journey as a seller on Genesus? We are here to help!
<br>
<br>
A good place to get started is to first setup your Genesus Seller Account. To do so, please visit www.genesus.co and create an account by clicking the "login" button in the top right of the page.
<br>
<br>
Once you have created an account, you can start building your next big idea! You can upload your own design, or work with our library of over 10,000 pieces of clip art and more than 50 fonts.
<br>
<br>
First, you will be able to decide on which product you'd like to produce. We offer 20+ off the top nutritional products on the market. You'll then decide on how many units you'd like to sell and how much profit you'd like to take. Finally, you'll add a brief title and description to explain your campaign and why people should buy your product.
<br>
<br>
And voila, that's how to launch your first Genesus campaign!

                  In the US, you are required by law to file a Form 1099 if you receive more than $600 in profits from Genesus. Sellers with multiple accounts will need to update their account information on all of their accounts as we will be merging their payout amount into one 1099 form. Only INDIVIDUALS will receive a Form 1099 from Teespring. All other types (Corporations, partnerships, LLCs, and international entities etc.) are responsible for reporting taxes themselves by consulting a tax accountant.

                  On Genesus, we allow you to include a goal for each campaign to show your buyers what you're hoping to achieve in terms of sales. Setting your goal also allows you to estimate how much money you will make per product, if that goal is reached. If the goal isn't reached, we'll still manufacture and ship your products as long as you've made a profit.

DOMESTIC SHIPPING
Once a campaign ends, we begin the printing process.  This takes about a week.  From there, all domestic orders take approximately one (1) week to ship.
                  <br>
                  <br>
So your order will always arrive approximately two (2) weeks after the campaign has ended, not two (2) weeks after you place your order.

                  The concept behind trademark rights is that the owner of the mark has the legal right to stop people from trading off of the value of the company’s brand and reputation. They can do so by stopping the use of any confusingly similar trademark.
                  <br>
                  <br>
So if an unknown car company wants to use the mark “VMW” to identify their new car, BMW will be able to stop them from doing so based on the similarity of the marks themselves and the goods they are used to identify.
                   <br>
                   <br>
Often trademark owners will also secure rights in other related goods that they want to sell – for example, supplements.

For example, in one famous case, a photographer was found to have copied the photograph of another artist even though he used a different model and location. The original creative details of the second photograph were so similar to the first (the look, layout and subject matter) that the court found copyright infringement.
