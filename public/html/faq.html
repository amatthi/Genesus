                    If you decide that you no longer want your order for any reason you can cancel it. ​Once a campaign ends, however, we are unable to cancel an order as the information has already been sent to the manufacturer and the item will be shipped anyway.  In this instance, you can return your item once you receive it for a full refund.

                  All sales transactions take place once the minimum number of orders required to manufacture the campaign have been met.  This number is generated by a wide variety of factors, so it will differ between campaigns. Generally, though, the minimum tends to be between 3-5 orders.
                  <br>
This will always be one-time charge, no matter the circumstance.

                  There are two ways to place a Genesus order. One way is on a computer, and the other is over a mobile device. On both devices, these are the steps to follow:

1. Navigate to the campaign page you're interested in
                  <br>

                  Genesus was born on a whim and founded by Alek and Austin Matthiessen while the two were seniors at Brown University and Emory University. When it was revealed that one of their favorite supplement companies was putting metals in their products, they began to immediately search for ways to manufacture the supplement themselves. They were stunned with how hard it was to find high quality ingredients from a trusted manufacturer. Learning that they couldn't even talk to the reputable one because of high minimum order quantities, they knew there had to be a better way.
                  <br>
The Genesus platform allows people to take their own personal brand and experience, create various supplements, and then sell them without the overhead costs or restrictions usually associated with starting an online store. Our platform sells the items in campaigns (or limited edition runs) so we can manufacture and ship in bulk. This process keeps our costs low and allows us to help build small brands by offering fair and profitable pricing on manufacturing and products to our sellers.

                  In the US, you are required by law to file a Form 1099 if you receive more than $600 in profits from Genesus. Sellers with multiple accounts will need to update their account information on all of their accounts as we will be merging their payout amount into one 1099 form. Only INDIVIDUALS will receive a Form 1099 from Teespring. All other types (Corporations, partnerships, LLCs, and international entities etc.) are responsible for reporting taxes themselves by consulting a tax accountant.

                  The concept behind trademark rights is that the owner of the mark has the legal right to stop people from trading off of the value of the company’s brand and reputation. They can do so by stopping the use of any confusingly similar trademark.
                  <br>
So if an unknown car company wants to use the mark “VMW” to identify their new car, BMW will be able to stop them from doing so based on the similarity of the marks themselves and the goods they are used to identify.
                   <br>
Often trademark owners will also secure rights in other related goods that they want to sell – for example, supplements.
                    <br>
Genesus creators are not allowed to use third party trademarks unless they have permission. Here are a few examples of products that feature trademarked material.

                  Shipping is a flat $3.00 per item for any recepients in the United States.
                  <br>
All items offered on Genesus.co are custom made-to-order.  This is how we're able to offer unique/original supplements, free of cost to our sellers.
                  <br>
DOMESTIC SHIPPING
Once a campaign ends, we begin the printing process.  This takes about a week.  From there, all domestic orders take approximately one (1) week to ship.
                  <br>
So your order will always arrive approximately two (2) weeks after the campaign has ended, not two (2) weeks after you place your order.

The original creative details of the second photograph were so similar to the first (the look, layout and subject matter) that the court found copyright infringement.
