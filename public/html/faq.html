                  We've partnered with manufacturers all of the United States to produce supplements we can believe in. Each of our facilities is cGMP certified, FDA Registered, and makes all of their raw ingredients in the United States of America. Each of our products is also 100% transparent and free of any additives or fillers. As standard procedure we test all incoming raw materials, as well as finished products, and test each batch for disintegration time.

                  We also use amber colored recyclable glass bottles preserve freshnessglass bottles, labels list all ingredients to avoid consumer allergic reactions to unnamed ingredients, Best By dates guarantee freshness, and full body, tamper-evident sleeves ensure consumer safety. It is our mission to raise the standard for nutrition product manufacturing.

                  Since the beginning, we’ve gone one step further in assuring the gluten free status of our products by testing our finished products for gluten. We confirm that none of the products we offer contain more than 10 ppm gluten, and use this logo on the front panel of the label. Our program provides a consistent, science-based set of standards that helps consumers easily choose our premium supplements. In mid-2013 the FDA announced a decision defining Gluten Free as 20ppm, more than double what we allow in products. All finished products undergo gluten testing using an ELISA (Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) procedure (a machine that detects the presence of an antigen in a sample) to detect the presence of gluten.

                  We believe offering organic alternatives to dietary supplements provides the end consumer with a wholesome product that supports the cycle of global sustainability and thus adds value for our retail accounts. All our products are nestled in plant-based biodegradable packaging materials and shipped in corrugated cartons with an overall recycled content of 65% (considered to be the highest recycled content possible while maintaining box integrity during packing and shipping). More than half of our products meet the guidelines of the USDA National Organic Program.

                  A number of our customers are concerned about the genetic modification (GM) status of dietary supplement ingredients. Here is information on our product line regarding the labeling and marketing of products that do not contain Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs).
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Regarding supplement ingredients, many of our suppliers feel confident to say their ingredients are non-GMO even though they don’t have documentation to support it. In these cases, there may not be any plant material contained in the ingredient or product that can be genetically modified to begin with.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  An example is our Borage Oil. Our supplier feels, and we agree, it is non-GMO because there are no GM Borage plants developed to date.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Other suppliers provide statements that say, “(xxx) ingredient is not manufactured from GM ingredients and thus is not subject to labeling under Regulations 1829/2003/EC and 1830/2003/EC (European regulations)” or “the product is produced by chemical synthesis without the involvement of genetic engineering and is therefore GMO free.”
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Others simply check a box saying the ingredient is “non-GMO” but do not have further documentation. One example is our vegetarian capsules made from cellulose from Pine trees that are not genetically modified in the first place. Another is our vitamin B6 which is synthetically manufactured using certain chemicals (no plant origin), thus they could not have introduced GM material during their manufacturing process.

                  In 2006, the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act (FALCPA) went into effect. The law requires food and dietary supplement manufacturers to clearly list if any of the identified common food allergens are present in the product: wheat, soy, egg, milk, fish, crustacean shellfish, peanuts and/or tree nuts. These eight foods account for 90% of the food allergies. Our “Contains No” statements on all of our product labels is in accordance with the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act (FALCPA) allergen label requirements; a full statement looks like this: “Contains No artificial colors, flavors or preservatives; no wheat, gluten, milk, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, soy, crustacean shellfish or fish.”

                Because you aren't altering the product once it leaves our manufacturing facility, you aren't liable for any of damages the ingredients may cause. We also ensure all labels meet FDA regulation, so you aren't responsible for any false claims.

                  Genesus was born on a whim and founded by Alek and Austin Matthiessen while the two were seniors at Brown University and Emory University. After using nutrition products for 10 years, they realized most of the brands they purchased were misleading about what is actually in their products. Metals, fillers, and additives all were stuffed in the same products they were putting in their bodies and they had no idea. the formula's used similar ingredients, but they were filled with metals, additives, and fillers. They tried to start their own brand, but the process was horrific, sending quotes back and forth and putting up thousands of dollars. They knew there had to be a better way, so they built one.
