  <h2 style="font-family:'Dosis', sans-serif;">YOU'RE RIGHT TO KNOW</h2>
  <h3 style="color:#777;font-size:26px;line-height:1.3;font-weight:300;">Genesus is passionately committed to creating a world that is free of genetically modified organsims, or GMOs. We believe everyone has a right to know what they are consuming and what chemicals
  are used in the supplements that they consume every day. That's why we have carefully screened our products to ensure we do carry as few GMO supplements as possible. We also focus on providing USDA Certified Organic options wherever they exist. Genetically Modified Organisms are prohibited under the USDA Organic Guidelines.</h3>

<h2 style="font-family:'Dosis', sans-serif;">LABEL IT</h2>
<h3 style="color:#777;font-size:26px;line-height:1.3;font-weight:300;">We believe supplements containing any genetically engineered ingredients should be clearly labeled. While the United States does not yet legally mandate the labeling of GMOs, we are committed to transparency about the products we sell on Genesus. Many of the supplements we carry are certified by the non-GMO project and/or certified Organic by the USDA, which prohibits the use of GMOs.</h3>

  <h2 style="font-family:'Dosis', sans-serif;">A SIMPLE SOLUTION</h2>
  <h3 style="color:#777;font-size:26px;line-height:1.3;font-weight:300;">Genetic engineering is an extremely important issue, and also one of the most complex issues. Tracing GMO ingredients with 100 percent accuracy
  is extremely difficult, as cross-pollination and seed drift can contaminate natural crops with genetically modified pollen. More than 70 percent of food sold in the United States contains some genetically engineered ingredients and we know how difficult
it can be for shoppers to always take the time to find out what is in their food. At Genesus, you can trust that we will do our best to never sell GMO supplements and we promise to make it right if something with genetically engineered ingredients should make it on to the site.</h3>
