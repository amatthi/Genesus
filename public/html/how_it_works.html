                All sales transactions take place once the minimum number of orders required to manufacture the campaign have been met.  This number is generated by a wide variety of factors, so it will differ between campaigns. Generally, though, the minimum tends to be between 3-5 orders.

                There are two ways to place a Genesus order. One way is on a computer, and the other is over a mobile device. On both devices, these are the steps to follow:
                <br>
                <br>
1. Navigate to the campaign page you're interested in
                <br>
                <br>
2. Click the green button, which will either say "Reserve It Now" or "Buy It Now"

                Genesus was born on a whim and founded by Alek and Austin Matthiessen while the two were seniors at Brown University and Emory University. After using nutrition products for 10 years, they realized most of the formula's used similar ingredients, but they were filled with metals, additives, and fillers. They tried to start their own brand, but the process was horrific, sending quotes back and forth and putting up thousands of dollars. They knew there had to be a better way, so they built one.
                <br>
                <br>
                The Genesus platform allows people to take their own personal brand and experience, create various supplements, and then sell them without the overhead costs or restrictions usually associated with starting an online store. Our platform sells the items in campaigns (or limited edition runs) so we can manufacture and ship in bulk. This process keeps our costs low and allows us to help build small brands by offering fair and profitable pricing on manufacturing and products to our sellers.

                We've partnered with manufacturers all of the United States to produce supplements we can believe in. Each of our facilities is cGMP certified, FDA Registered, and makes all of their raw ingredients in the United States of America. Each of our products is also 100% transparent and free of any additives or fillers. As standard procedure we test all incoming raw materials, as well as finished products, and test each batch for disintegration time.

We also use amber colored recyclable glass bottles preserve freshnessglass bottles, labels list all ingredients to avoid consumer allergic reactions to unnamed ingredients, Best By dates guarantee freshness, and full body, tamper-evident sleeves ensure consumer safety.

                Since the beginning, weâ€™ve gone one step further in assuring the gluten free status of our products by testing our finished products for gluten. We confirm that none of the products we offer contain more than 10 ppm gluten, and use this logo on the front panel of the label. Our program provides a consistent, science-based set of standards that helps consumers easily choose our premium supplements. In mid-2013 the FDA announced a decision defining Gluten Free as 20ppm, more than double what we allow in products. All finished products undergo gluten testing using an ELISA (Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) procedure (a machine that detects the presence of an antigen in a sample) to detect the presence of gluten.
