Its antioxidant action will protect cells and organs, and will, hypothetically, slow the aging process and prevent injury, illness and disease.",US National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK11896/,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,N-Acetyle L-Cystine,,,,,"Researchers have long known that N-acetyl-L-cysteine, an antioxidant compound, supports bronchial and respiratory health. At the core of its power is its ability to support healthy cellular levels of glutathione. But now a wave of new research is showing powerful benefits on overall health. More than 30 placebo-controlled studies on cellular glutathione have shown that N-acetyl-L-cysteine can affect energy production, well-being, and quality of life. Today, N-acetyl-L-cysteine is prized as a highly bioavailable nutrient that supports your immune system, helps protect neurons during times of oxidative stress, and enhances liver function.",US National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3270338/,,,,,,,,

Done with the addities. Nice alternative,Whey Protein Isolate,$44.95,37,Excellent,John,"Whey isolate is one of the most complete forms of protein available and because it lacks carbs, fats, cholesterol and lactose, a single serving of whey isolate may provide your body with all of the amino acids it needs to promote ideal health results from workout and fitness efforts.*",US National Library of MedicineNational Institutes of Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21912246,Low Fat,Low Sodium,High Fructose Corn Syrup Free,"Based on our research to maximize your results, add one scoop to beverage of your choice before, after, or during exercise.. Thoroughly shake or blend until the product is well dispensed. ",20,"At the heart of this whey protein is one of the most powerful protein sources on the planet - Whey Isolate from Wisconsin Cows. These cows come from smaller farms, have access to grazing in fresh pasture and are not treated with rBGH (recombinant bovine growth hormone). The soy used for easier mixing is non-GMO, analytically confirmed to be GMO free by DNA-level testing. This Whey is manufactured by using state-of-the-art cold processing and cross-flow microfiltration technology, allowing for many essential nutrients and immune factors to remain intact, along with all those muscle-supporting amino acids. Many other proteins use a less efficient, high heat process, destroying much of what protein should contain.",,

They have been found in the tomb of the Egyptian pharaoh Tutankhamun and have been found numerous times in ancient Greek manuscripts. Safflower oil is a potent source of polyunsaturated fats or PUFAs. PUFAs assist in the lowering of bad cholesterol levels in the blood, and can therefore mitigate the risks of developing heart diseases especially if PUFAs are utilized as a substitute for saturated fats and trans fats.*",Journal of Clinical Lipidology,http://www.nutraingredients.com/Research/Safflower-infused-muffins-a-potential-aid-for-weight-loss-Study,No Artificial Ingredients,Soy Free,Dairy Free,"Based on our research to maximize your results, take one softgel 3-4 times daily.",20,"Conjugated Linoleic Acid, or CLA, is an essential omega-6 fatty acid found naturally in the fat of beef and dairy products. Since low-fat beef and dairy have become the norm in the American diet, CLA consumption has dropped and, not coincidentally, obesity has been on the rise. CLA helps to reduce the storage of extra calories as fat while also helping to utilize existing fat in cells for energy. Recent studies have shown significant reduction in abdominal adipose tissue in persons taking significant amounts of CLA on a daily basis.",,

It is the oldest living tree species in the world. The Ginkgo species dates all the way back to the Permian Period some 286 to 248 million years ago.For thousands of years, leaves from the Ginkgo biloba tree have been a common treatment in Chinese medicine where they used it to improve blood flow to the brain and as an antioxidant. It is best known today as way to potentially keep your memory sharp.*",National Institute of Health,https://nccih.nih.gov/research/results/gems/qa.htm,Full Of Omegas,Vegan,Dairy Free,"Based on our research to maximize your results, take 2 softgels once daily with water.",20,"Since memory seems to decline first in most people, this formula contains ginkgo biloba and rosemary which are known to help promote healthy circulation to the brain. It also contains B-vitamins to help support homocysteine levels already within a normal range. Phosphatidylserine and phosphatidyl-choline both maintain the cell membrane surrounding brain cells, thereby helping to ensure proper cell signaling between neurons. Omega-3 fish oils used to thin the blood and improve circulation also may assist healthy brain function. ",,
,,,,,,,,,,,Phosphatidylserine,,,,,"Phosphatidylserine (PS) is a fatty acid that affects the neurotransmitters that affect memory, is a component of the cellâ€™s membrane, and is a major phospholipid in the brain and nervous system. It supports nerve cells, releases neurotransmitters (acetylcholine and dopamine) in the brain to support cognition and memory.* PS has a positive impact on behavior and is needed for proper metabolism of fatty acids and to maintain a healthy immune system.*",US National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2966935/,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,Fish Oil,,,,,"Omega-3 fatty acids are considered essential fatty acids. They are necessary for human health, but the body can't make them. Also known as polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), omega-3 fatty acids play a crucial role in brain function, as well as normal growth and development. They have also become popular because they may reduce the risk of heart disease.*",National Institute of Health,https://nccih.nih.gov/health/omega3/introduction.htm,,,,,,,,
