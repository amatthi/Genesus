Safflower oil is a potent source of polyunsaturated fats or PUFAs. PUFAs assist in the lowering of bad cholesterol levels in the blood, and can therefore mitigate the risks of developing heart diseases especially if PUFAs are utilized as a substitute for saturated fats and trans fats.*",Journal of Clinical Lipidology,http://www.nutraingredients.com/Research/Safflower-infused-muffins-a-potential-aid-for-weight-loss-Study,No Artificial Ingredients,Soy Free,Dairy Free,$11.22,20,"Conjugated linoleic acid, or CLA, is an essential omega-6 fatty acid found naturally in the fat of beef and dairy products. CLA is unique such that it can help to reduce the storage of extra calories as fat while also helping to utilize existing fat in cells for energy. Studies have shown significant reduction in abdominal apidose tissue in persons taking high amounts of CLA on a daily basis. In addition, CLA can be beneficial for cardiovascular health, cellular reproduction, and healthy blood sugar.",,
